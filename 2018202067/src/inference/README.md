# Web App

## Files

- `page.py` connects the front end and the back end of the dynamic web app.
- `inference.py` does the inference process of the pretained deep neural network.

## Usage

Please download our pretrained ResNet-101 model from [here](链接: https://pan.baidu.com/s/12VAHFFPW9i1DQsBYYNtuXg  密码: 28ss) with password `28ss`, and store the file `leafsnap_model2.pth` at `/static/model` before you run the inference project.

To run the web, run `python3 page.py`
